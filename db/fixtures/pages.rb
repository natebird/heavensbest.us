This obligation is subject to you notifying Lucidius promptly in writing of the IP Claim (but in no event later than ten (10) days following your receipt of notice of such IP Claim), giving Lucidius exclusive control of the defense and settlement thereof, and providing reasonable assistance and authority necessary to perform Lucidius' obligations hereunder, at Lucidius' expense.
#   4.3. Exclusions From Defense Obligation.  Lucidius will have no duty to defend any IP Claim to the extent such IP Claim is based on:  (i) use of a superseded release of the Lucidius Technology or portion thereof, if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current release of the Lucidius Technology and Lucidius timely notified you of the availability of the non-infringing release at no additional cost; (ii) the combination, operation, or use of the Lucidius Technology furnished under this Agreement with programs or data not furnished by Lucidius or with hardware or operating system Software other than the hardware platform and operating system with which the Lucidius Technology is designed to function, if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Lucidius Technology without such programs, data, hardware or operating system; (iii) compliance with designs, plans or specifications furnished by or on your behalf; (iv) modification or attempted modification of the Lucidius Technology by anyone except Lucidius or use or distribution of such modifications; or (v) your use of the Lucidius Technology in a manner that results in defamation, violates the privacy rights of individuals, transmits material in violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or uses any proprietary third party content without legally binding consent of such third party.
#   4.4. Licensee's Obligation to Defend.  To the extent an IP Claim is excluded from Lucidius' defense obligation by reason of Section 4.3 above ('Excluded Claims'), you will, at your sole expense, defend or settle the Excluded Claim.  This obligation is subject to Lucidius notifying you promptly in writing of the Excluded Claim (but in no event later than ten (10) days following Lucidius receipt of notice of such Excluded Claim), giving you exclusive control of the defense thereof, and providing reasonable assistance and authority necessary to perform your obligations hereunder, at your expense.

#   4.6. Remedies.  In the event that use of the Lucidius Technology becomes, or in Lucidius' reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of an IP Claim other than an Excluded Claim, Lucidius will, at its option and expense:  (a) obtain the continuing right to use the Lucidius Technology for you; (b) modify the Lucidius Technology so that it no longer infringes so long as the modified Lucidius Technology retains substantially similar functionality; or (c) replace it with a product that does not infringe and has substantially similar functionality.  If none of these remedies are available on commercially reasonable terms, then Lucidius may terminate the license and refund the unamortized portion of the license fees paid (if any) for the infringing Lucidius Technology prorated over a sixty (60)-month period.
