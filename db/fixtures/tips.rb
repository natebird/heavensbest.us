#   REPOSITION YOUR RUG EVERY 6 MONTHS, 180 DEGREES.
#   This will allow for even wear over many years to come. It will also permit you to inspect your rug, 
#   carefully checking under the rug, pad, and floor for critters or other evidence of parasites. 
#   You will also be able to clean your floor!
# 
#   Step #2
#   VACUUM VERY CAREFULLY
#   Vacuuming should be done with a vacuum having a beater bar only, no brushes. Also, be careful not to 
#   catch the fringe in the beater bar. If this is done by someone other than yourself, be sure to give 
#   them proper instructions. Again, always be alert to infestations of any kind. 
# 
#   Step #3
#   INTERIM MAINTENANCE (BETWEEN WASHINGS) AIR-DUST & DEODORIZE
#   This is to freshen your rugs in between regular thorough washing. AIR-DUSTING & DEODORIZING will remove 
#   impacted soils, dust, pollen, pet dander, and other allergens. We provide same day service by picking 
#   up your rug in the morning and returning them that afternoon. This is an investment in your rug for 
#   about half of our rug washing service.
# 
#   Step #4
#   THOROUGH WASHING OF RUGS EVERY 1-3 YEARS
#   Authentic hand-washing of rugs should only be done by an IN-PLANT FACILITY. Never, never should you 
#   entrust your rug to an on-location carpet cleaner. As we have already mentioned, oriental and other 
#   natural fiber rugs need to be totally immersed in water. This will allow every square inch of the rug 
#   to be rinsed, flushed, and groomed so as to be free from contamination and abrasive soil. Washing rugs 
#   puts back much needed moisture."
