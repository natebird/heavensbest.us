Dear <%= @user.name %>,

As a web design company, Lucidius LLC, has received requests from several Heaven's Best operators for websites to better advertise, inform, and run internet marketing campaigns for their customers. For the past nine months, we have been building a web application, www.heavensbest.us, specifically for Heaven's Best operators. And as of January 2009, the beta version of the site is ready to launch and for operators to sign on. 

This invite only service will serve as a directory guiding customers quickly to their local operators. It also allows local operators to customize their sub-site with their specific contact and services. Every operator who participates benefits from increased search rankings since it is a shared domain name.

This website is made with simplicity and convenience in mind. Each operator is given a link, username, and password, located at the end of this email, to sign up for an account. Once signed in, you can create multiple areas to fit your needs. You can have your account and areas set up within minutes. And you can come back at any time to edit or remove any information.

The site is designed to draw customers' attention to (1) local operator's phone numbers to set up appointments, (2) descriptive details of services provided by individual areas with professionally written text and images, (3) specials and discounts, and (4) testimonials of satisfied customers. All of the listed features are easily managed and can be edited by you to best fit your area needs. Lucidius will be offering more features in the future to keep the site updated with the needs and wants of operators and customers. 

Currently, we are offering each area a 30-day free trial. After the free trial, the price for the site is $35 a month per area. The cost pays for the site with the features mentioned above and a heavensbest.us email address as a more professional way of communicating with your customers. 

Lastly, each area is designed to be search engine friendly. We've partnered with Mitch Brian at WSI to handle all of your internet marketing needs. You can reach him at info@wsigo.com or by phone at 208-521-5050 for questions specifically regarding internet marketing. 

We know that www.heavensbest.us can serve you and your website needs by giving you a better online representation. 

Sincerely,

Nate Bird, CEO
