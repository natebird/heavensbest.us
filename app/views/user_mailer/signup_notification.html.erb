Dear <%= @user.name %>,

You have been invited to try the heavensbest.us web site. The site is a collaborative effort between Randy Bird, the Washington state owner and Lucidius, a web design company specializing in custom web applications. For the past year, we have been building this site to meet the needs of all Heaven's Best operators. We are now extending our invitations to all operators in the United States.

This invite only service serves as a directory to guide customers quickly to their local operators. It also allows local operators to customize their sub-site with their specific contact information and services. Every operator who participates benefits from increased search rankings since it is a shared domain name.

This website is made with simplicity and convenience in mind. Each operator is given a link, username, and password, located at the end of this email, to sign up for an account. Once signed in, you can create multiple areas to fit your needs. You can have your account and areas set up within minutes. And you can come back at any time to edit or remove any information.

The site is designed to draw customers' attention to (1) local operator's phone numbers to set up appointments, (2) descriptive details of services provided by individual areas with professionally written text and images, (3) specials and discounts, and (4) testimonials of satisfied customers. All of the listed features are easily managed and can be edited by you to best fit your area needs. Lucidius will be offering more features in the future to keep the site updated with the needs and wants of operators and customers. 

Currently, we are offering each area a 30-day free trial. After the free trial, the price for the site is $35 a month per area. The cost pays for the site with the features mentioned above, a heavensbest.us email address, and downloadable video tutorials.  

Lastly, each area is designed to be search engine friendly. Included in the monthly cost is on going training and access to tutorials, articles, and tips to better market your site on the internet. 

We know that heavensbest.us along with the training resources will make your site a success and bring new customers and jobs to you for a fraction of your advertising budget.

Sincerely,

Nate Bird, President
