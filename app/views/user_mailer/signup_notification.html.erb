Hello <%= @user.name %>,

My name is Nate Bird. I've been working to create a website for Heaven's Best operators. This project started 9 months ago when my dad, Randy Bird, the State owner in Washington, wanted two sites for his areas so he could run some Google AdWordsâ„¢ campaigns. While building his sites a number of operators asked for sites too. Instead of creating a custom site for each operator I decided to build a web application where any operator could have an account and build as many areas as needed under a single website. This allows me to create a lot of sites quickly and host them. Operators benefit by common features, easy setup and maintenance, and accumulated search engine rankings.

I talked to Cody all along the way and recently received approval to create sites for operators. I've been working hard to finish up the final details for the last month. We are close to opening up the site to a few select operators to test and provide feedback. In exchange you'll get first access to the site. We will launch as soon as we can at http://www.heavensbest.us.

Below are a few of the features currently available on the site. The great thing about our service is that the site will continually get better, easier to use, and we can add more features as needed.

Multiple Areas
You can have as many areas (websites) as you want. It is easy to create new areas and maintain them. It only takes a few minutes and the results from each area can be better tracked and maintained.

Services, Testimonials & Specials
We provide you with two default services but you can add as many as you need. We have created styles and images that provide a professional feel no matter what the content is. Each new area will get some default testimonials from around the nation. We hope you will be able to gather testimonials from loyal customers and replace the generic ones with specific and local testimonies of the great service and experiences you've provided. Specials are a great way to attract customers to your site. Whether through internet marketing with WSI or your own campaign specials will allow you to provide timely specials and drive people to your site and call you for appointments. 

Depending on the plan you choose you can have as many Services, Testimonials, and Specials as your areas need.

Evolving Features
As a hosted service we continually work to improve the features and keep your site fresh and updated. Part of this involves adding new features, simplifying site management, and working with you and other operators to satisfy the needs of your customers.

Internet Marketing
Each area is setup to be search engine optimized. We've partnered with WSI and they can handle all of your internet marketing campaigns and any questions you may have.

Pricing
We have three tiers of service. The Basic Plan ($10/month) includes a basic site with the two default services and default testimonials. The Plus Plan ($20/month) allows you to have as many services and testimonials as you need as well as be able to run one special at a time. The Premier Plan ($30/month) has all the features of the Plus Plan as well as an area email address, site statistics, and email list manager, and online scheduling.

The Launch
The site is currently in beta and I'm looking for a few operators to test the site and provide feedback as we move to launch. If you are interested follow the instructions below.
