Hello <%= @user.name %>,

My name is Nate Bird. I've been working to create a website for Heaven's Best operators. This project started 9 months ago when my dad, Randy Bird, the State owner in Washington, wanted two sites for his areas so he could run some Google AdWordsâ„¢ campaigns. While building his sites a number of operators asked for sites too. Instead of creating a custom site for each operator I decided to build a web application where any Heaven's Best operator could have an account and build as many areas as needed under a single website. This allows me to create a lot of sites quickly and manage the hosting for them. Operators benefit by common features, easy setup and maintenance, a low monthly cost, and accumulated search engine rankings.

I talked to Cody all along the way and recently received approval to create sites for operators. I've been working hard to finish up the final details for the last month. We are close to opening up the site to a few select operators to test and provide feedback. In exchange you'll get first access to the site. We will launch as soon as we can at http://www.heavensbest.us.

Below are a few of the features currently available on the site. The great thing about our service is that the site will continually get better, easier to use, and we can add more features as needed.

Multiple Areas
You can create as many areas (websites) as you want. It is easy to create new areas and maintain them. It only takes a few minutes and the results from each area can be tracked and maintained. You also can link directly to your area for internet marketing campaigns.

Services, Testimonials & Specials
We have written text and added images that provide a professional feel. We provide you with a number of default services and testimonials. You can add or remove as many as you want. We hope you will gather testimonials from your own loyal customers and replace the generic ones with specific and local testimonies of the great service and experiences you've provided. Specials are a great way to attract customers to your site. Whether through internet marketing with WSI or your own campaign, specials will allow you to provide timely specials to drive customers to your site and call you for appointments. 

Evolving Features
As a hosted service we continually work to improve the features and keep your site fresh and updated. Part of this involves adding new features, simplifying site management, and working with you and other operators to satisfy the needs of your existing and potential customers.

Internet Marketing
Each area is setup to be search engine optimized. We've partnered with WSI and they can handle all of your internet marketing campaigns and any questions you may have. Mitch Brian is our contact and he can be reached by email at info@wsigo.com or by phone at 208-521-5050.

Pricing
We give every account a 30 day free trial. We currently have one subscription called our "Basic Plan" for $30/month. It includes default services and testimonials as well as a few sample specials. You can add or remove as many services, testimonials, and specials. You will also receive a heavensbest.us email address for each of your areas. 

The Launch
The site is currently in beta and I'm looking for a few operators to test the site and provide feedback as we move to launch. If you are interested follow the instructions below.
