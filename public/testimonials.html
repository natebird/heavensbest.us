				As an office manager for a Real Estate Office, we are pleased with our Heaven’s Best Operator. His services are frequently required at the ‘last minute’ of which he has always been accommodating. Additionally, his attitude is positive, his results are far above other vendors attempting to provide the same services and his prices are reasonable. </p>

				Our local operator has been our exclusive carpet cleaning contractor for a number of years. He was originally given jobs at projects where my on-site mangers were dissatisfied with their existing contractors. He immediately won over these managers because of his professionalism. In a short period of time he was able to become our exclusive carpet cleaning company. </p>

				For years I have had my carpet and sofa cleaned by companies that utilize steam and Chem-Dry methods. As a last resort I contacted Heaven’s Best because they promised a new image in carpet cleaning. Frankly, in view of my past experiences, my expectations were not very high, but I was in for a huge surprise. Heaven’s Best left a uniformly clean appearance that I never thought was possible. The odor in my home changed from musty to a refreshing citrus aroma. You have won a customer for life! </p>

				Heaven’s Best has been cleaning carpet at La Mirage for over a year. We have tried several carpet cleaning companies in the past and have been unsatisfied until now. Heaven’s Best is professional, courteous, and prompt. We are completely satisfied with the services they have provided to us. </p>

				Today Heaven’s Best did the impossible with the carpet in a rental property that we own. When I saw how bad the tenants had left them, I really thought we would have to rip them out. I am so glad I called Heaven’s Best. I could not believe what I saw. I will definitely be recommending Heaven’s best to my friends and relatives. </p>
