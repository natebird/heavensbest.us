== Heaven's Best

This is the source code for the heavensbest.us website (http://heavensbest.us).

It started as a Rails 2.x application and was deployed in 2008 for production. After a year or so of neglect it has been upgraded to Rails 3 and moved hosting providers. A lot of the original scope of the project has been reduced with maintainability as the highest priority.

It allows Heaven's Best operators to manage a simple website to promote their business locally. It also provides a directory of Heaven's best operators and references to their website regardless of if their are hosted in our system or not.

This source code was private for a long time and is now open source. It isn't the greatest code as it was written when I was first using Ruby and Rails. I've purposefully preserved the code structure for reference to how bad I used to code. :-)
